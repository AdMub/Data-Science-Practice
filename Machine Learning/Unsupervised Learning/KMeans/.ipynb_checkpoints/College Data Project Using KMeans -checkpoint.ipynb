    "\n",
    "when using the KMeans algorithm under normal circumstances, it is because you don't have labels. In this case we will use the labels to try to get an idea of how well the algorithm performed, but you won't usually do this for KMeans, so the classification report and confusion matrix at the end of this project, don't truly ,ake sense in a real wold setting!."
